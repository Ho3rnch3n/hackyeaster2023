# Description

# Sanity Check

This is your first flag!

Right here --> he2023{just_A_sanity_chEck}

ðŸš© Flags are in format `he2023{...}`, unless noted otherwise. Always check additional information given (uppercase, lowercase, spaces, etc.).

# Solution

well on the html page this looked like nothing was there:

```
<p>Right here --&gt; he2023{<span style="color: black; background-color: black; opacity: 0;">just_A_sanity_chEck</span>}</p>
```

so jeah copy paste did the thing already:

# Flag: he2023{just_A_sanity_chEck}
