# Igor's Gory Passwordsafe

You found the following letter:

Hi Peter

Thanks again for your help in cryptography to make the passwordsafe secure. Now

 - The passwords of the user are stored in a irreversible way (bcrypt)
 - All passwords in the safe are encrypted by a strong symmetric key

Kind regards, Roy

Open the passwordsafe at at <http://ch.hackyeaster.com:2312> to get your ðŸš© flag.

Note: The service is restarted every hour at x:00.

## Hints

No brute forcing needed, really!

# Solution

so we got a website, where we can register a user and then store passwords, so i tried sql injections everywhere but nothing, then i tried to modify the passwords with the update functionality, since the password ids were enumerable, but i was only able to modfy the users passwords

after some time and monitoring everything with burp i found that there was a function `copy password` with that your password got copied to your clipboard, and at the same time a GET request was sent (also with the same enumerable id) which returned the password

so i tried to get other passwords from that endpoint, and it worked!

```

```

gave the flag:

```

```

now the challenge name also makes sense to me!

# Flag: he2023{1d0R_c4n_d3str0y_ur_Crypt0_3ff0rt}
