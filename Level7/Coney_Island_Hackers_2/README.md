# Coney Island Hackers 2

Coney Island Hackers are back!

They changed the passphrase of their secret web portal to: `coneʸisland`.

However, they implemented some protection:

 - letters and some special characters are not allowed
 - maximum length of the string entered is 75

# Hints

eval


# Solution

so we need to enter characters, but without characters...

testing out i am not allowed to use these characters:

```
[A-Za-z]
\
$
```

so `"true"` = `(!0+[])`, `"false"` = `(!1+[])`, `"undefined"` = `([][[]]+[])`

the special character `ʸ` can apparently be entered without restrictions, with that the only letters i need to create are `c` and `o`

the input for `neʸisland` is:

```
([][[]]+[])[1]+(!0+[])[3]+"ʸ"+([][[]]+[])[5]+(!1+[])[3]+(!1+[])[2]+(!1+[])[1]+([][[]]+[])[1]+([][[]]+[])[2]
```

so even this is already too much...

reading some old writeups for other challenges i found this:

<https://0xdf.gitlab.io/hackvent2021>

so apparently i can use variables after all!

```
α=(!0+[]);β=(!1+[]);χ=([][[]]+[]);χ[1]+α[3]+"ʸ"+χ[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+χ[1]+χ[2]
```

well even this is too much... 77 chars, and i don't even have everything...

little improvements...

```
α=!0+[];β=!1+[];χ=α[9]+[];χ[1]+α[3]+"ʸ"+χ[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+χ[1]+χ[2]
```

after a bit more fiddeling around.. i am now able to write the whole word, but have 10 characters too much...

```
δ="ʸ";α=[δ+{}][0];β=!1+δ;χ=β[9]+δ;α[6]+α[2]+χ[1]+α[5]+δ+χ[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+χ[1]+χ[2]
```

shaved it down to 4 chars too much!

```
α=[]+{};β=!1+[];χ=β[9]+[];α[5]+α[1]+χ[1]+α[4]+"ʸ"+χ[5]+β[3]+β[2]+β[1]+χ[1]+χ[2]
```

got a hint to only use one variable!

```
α=!1+{}+[][[]];α[10]+α[6]+α[21]+α[23]+"ʸ"+α[25]+α[3]+α[2]+α[1]+α[21]+α[28]
```

this solved it!
