# A Mysterious Parchment

On their holiday, the bunnies came across a sleepy village with an interesting tower. While enjoying the view, one of them found a crumpled parchment in a corner. "Hah, that's clever!", the bunnies agreed after quickly solving the code and altered it ever so slightly.

## Hints

 - Who is Dagobert II and why isn't he here?
 - No cryptography is needed here - just need to look at the right thing!

# Solution

after doing a google reverse image search of the picture i got to this page:

<http://chuma.cas.usf.edu/~dietrich/rennes-summary5.htm>

there nearly the same picture is again, but i noticed that some letters are off... so just write down the letters i guess

jup this is a cipher as it seems according to:

<http://schmiede-des-wissens.de/?page_id=217>

so i had to read the letter which are a bit higher as the others

after some fiddeling around i got it

# FLAG: he2023{BUTISITACOOLOLDCODEITSUREIS}
