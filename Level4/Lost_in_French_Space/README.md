# Description

# Lost in (French) Space

My friend went to France and sent me coordinates of interesting things he found.

Three of them look legit, but one does not make sense to me.

 - `48.998 2.008`
 - `45.960 0.090`
 - `43.579 1.524`
 - `45.007 4.335`

ðŸš© Flag

 - the first word of the thing you find
 - six lowercase letters
 - wrapped in flag format, e.g. `he2023{thingy}`

## Hints
 - The three legitimate coordinates will lead you to the fourth.


# Solution

well the following actually really helped (in the end it did not but still a great tool), it is called google my maps, you can draw random stuff and multiple points on a map, really nice stuff!!

i did "connect the dots" and got in the middle of them `45.62182, 1.69536` but there was nothing

also all, but the second one got me to something space related, but i don't know

i used this coordinate `45.960 0.090` on space maps but also nothing...

i tried this site:

<https://theskylive.com/planetarium>

this looks very promising:

<https://trek.nasa.gov/mars>

also this:

<https://www.google.com/maps/space/mars/@45.3696313,0.3128765,1124640m/data=!3m1!1e3>

after way too much time i noticed that the coordinates are also visible on the google mars map in the address line and with that i found the correct position!
